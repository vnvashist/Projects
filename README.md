LSTM with Stock Forecasting
- Using deep learning I created a stock forecasting model that inputted single stock close values and outputted 30-100 day forecasts.

Trading Bot S&P
- I was interested in creating an algo trading bot that would automatically make trades for me on the strategy 'buy at the dip'. This bot used simple python if-else statements but used various finance metrics like moving averages and rsi to make decisions on when to buy and sell.
